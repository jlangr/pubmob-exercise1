## PubMob

PubMob is intended to be a social mob programming group. We have no set agenda yet. Goals: Learn how to mob more effectively, particularly remotely; learn better coding practices; learn other development skills; learn new languages; etc.

We do test-drive our code with straight-up TDD.

## Prerequisites

You're welcome to join the Pub Mob! First, though:

* Install [Mob](https://github.com/mobprogramming/mob). We'll be using Zoom, so try to configure the part about automating the Zoom share.
* Send me your Git user ID and I will send you an invite so that you can push to this repo.
* I'll have you do a test push to ensure you're able to push without troubles.

You will be able to work on your own machine with your own IDE. Please try to build and run tests for the current project before joining a session. We can help if you get stuck, but let us know ahead of time if possible.

You will be sharing your IDE or desktop. We ask that you also reveal youself on camera.

## Mobbing

All are welcome; please treat others with appropriate respect. The Golden Rule generally applies.

Rotations will be 4 minutes for the upcoming session; this is subject to change.

We rotate using the mob tool for remote programming (see above). (We will call it Mob for clarity moving forward.)

We generally follow strong style pairing guidelines, but we don't necessarily have a strict singular navigator.

We do brief restrospection for every runthrough of the mobbing lineup.

## Current Project Setup

The first project uses JavaScript with ES6. It uses Jest for a test runner. 

```
npm install
```

Make sure you can successfully run the tests:

```
npm run test -- --watch
```

or:

```
npm run test:watch
```
